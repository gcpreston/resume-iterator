spectatormode.tv, github.com/gcpreston/spectator_mode

- Streaming platform for Super Smash Bros. Melee via direct game data
Composed of a client program written in Rust to forward game data to a server, a backend written in Elixir to broadcast to viewers, and a SolidJS frontend to render live game data
- Supports auto-configuring multi-node deployment with each node having a synchronized view into all streams being run on the cluster, and where nodes can start and stop seamlessly at any time
- Other notable accomplishments include multiplexing all streams from one source over one socket to the backend, extracting the visualizer from a third-party project to a simple and reusable Web Component, and creating a necessary UBJSON parsing library in Rust in 1 day with Kiro AI IDE
